# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This file follows the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
format and adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- Add cross-process credential locking for refresh/write races in v0.1.1.
- Add broader PII redaction and error summarisation hardening in v0.1.1.
- Exact-pin runtime dependencies in v0.1.1 after the cohort policy lands.
- Migrate to `McpServer` + `registerTool` + Zod schemas in v0.2.0 or later.
- Add Zod validation for Google API response payloads in v0.2.0 or later.
- Unify account slug generation with the host `generateInstanceId` helper in v0.2.0 or later.

### Known limitations
- v0.1.0 keeps the existing host-catalog `_meta.com.mindstone.rebel` manifest bridge for round-trip identity.

### Removed
- Dead unused legacy `src/utils/token.ts` and `src/utils/account.ts` modules. Use `modules/accounts/token.ts` and `modules/accounts/manager.ts` instead.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-19

### Added
- Initial Google Workspace MCP server with tools for Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Contacts, Comments, and account diagnostics.
- Optional Google Tasks and Forms tools behind `ENABLE_GOOGLE_TASKS_FORMS=true`.
- Host-orchestrated OAuth setup via structured `auth_required` responses.

### Security
- Removed the bundled callback server so OAuth URLs and callback handling stay with the MCP host.
- Added atomic credential writes, token-refresh disable gating, request timeouts, and internal-reference checks.
- Sanitized attachment filenames to prevent path traversal via crafted `upload_workspace_attachment` filename argument.
- Extended `<untrusted-content>` envelope coverage to Contacts, Calendar, Comments, Forms, Tasks, and JSON-return paths.
- Completed Drive recovery-guidance contract coverage.
