# Changelog

All notable changes to this connector are documented here.

This file follows the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
format and adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

The history below `[Unreleased]` was reconstructed from git history during the
`@mindstone-engineering` to `@mindstone` npm scope migration; subsequent entries
are maintained manually as part of the PR review checklist.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-14
### Added
- **registry**: Cohort B + C backfill — 13 OSS connectors get server.json (12 also get mcpName). google-analytics, hubspot, outreach, quickbooks, salesforce, servicenow, slack, workday, zendesk, office (5-service consolidator), apple-shortcuts, browser-automation, email-imap each gain a registry-shaped server.json validated against registry.modelcontextprotocol.io. mcpName added to 12 of 13 package.json files; browser-automation deferred due to a concurrent agent's uncommitted 0.1.5→0.1.6 version bump in the same file.

### Fixed
- **ci**: Add npm overrides for fast-uri, hono, ip-address across all connectors.

### Changed
- Republished under the `@mindstone` npm scope. The legacy `@mindstone-engineering/mcp-server-*` package on this version line will be deprecated as part of the FOX-3319 scope migration; see [MIGRATION.md](../../MIGRATION.md) for the procedure consumers should follow.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added
- **google-analytics**: Add Google Analytics 4 MCP server. New rebel-oss connector exposing 25 read-only tools across reporting, schema discovery, and admin visibility for GA4.
