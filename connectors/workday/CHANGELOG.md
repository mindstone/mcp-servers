## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **registry**: Cohort B + C backfill — 13 OSS connectors get server.json (12 also get mcpName). google-analytics, hubspot, outreach, quickbooks, salesforce, servicenow, slack, workday, zendesk, office (5-service consolidator), apple-shortcuts, browser-automation, email-imap each gain a registry-shaped server.json validated against registry.modelcontextprotocol.io. mcpName added to 12 of 13 package.json files; browser-automation deferred due to a concurrent agent's uncommitted 0.1.5→0.1.6 version bump in the same file.

### Fixed
- **ci**: Add npm overrides for fast-uri, hono, ip-address across all connectors.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed
- **workday**: Apply cohort sweep — read SERVER_VERSION from package.json (createRequire), add destructiveHint:true to mutating tools, add openWorldHint:true to remote-API tools (false on configure_*). Bump to 0.2.1. Mirrors retell-ai 92c9a40 fix to prevent SERVER_VERSION drift and align tool annotations across the cohort.

### Security
- **deps**: Bump vulnerable transitive deps to patched versions across all connectors. Resolves 52 dependabot moderate-severity alerts (27 hono, 22 postcss, 1 each @hono/node-server, esbuild, uuid).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-11

### Fixed
- **batch3**: fix 4 blocking scrutiny issues for runway, workday, quickbooks
- **bridge**: clean brand references from template and batch1 connectors

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **workday**: externalize Workday MCP connector to standalone package
