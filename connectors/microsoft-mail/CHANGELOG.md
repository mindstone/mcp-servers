# Changelog

All notable changes to `@mindstone/mcp-server-microsoft-mail` are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- Migrate to `@mindstone/mcp-server-microsoft-shared` from its npm-registry version once `0.1.0` of the shared package is published; the `0.1.0` cohort port currently consumes the shared package as a packed `file:` dependency.
- Tighten Zod validation of Microsoft Graph response payloads in `0.2.0` or later.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-19

Initial public release of the Microsoft 365 Outlook Mail MCP server. Twelve tools across mail listing, search, send, reply, forward, draft, move, and delete via Microsoft Graph.

### Added
- Twelve mail tools: `authenticate_microsoft_account`, `list_emails`, `get_email`, `send_email`, `search_emails`, `reply_to_email`, `forward_email`, `delete_email`, `list_folders`, `move_email`, `create_reply_draft`, `create_draft`.
- Host-orchestrated OAuth handoff: `authenticate_microsoft_account` returns the structured `auth_required` envelope so the host runs the desktop OAuth flow.
- Token-refresh fail-closed mode via `MICROSOFT_DISABLE_REFRESH=1` (defaults to off; the cloud surface flips it on so tokens cannot rotate without the desktop session).
- Cohort 60s upstream-request timeout with `MICROSOFT_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` override; abort signals compose via `AbortSignal.any()`.

### Security
- Uses the new `McpServer + registerTool + Zod` SDK pattern (cohort `MCP_SERVER_STANDARD`).
- Reads version from `package.json` via `createRequire(import.meta.url)`, so the reported server version cannot drift from the npm artifact.
- Internal-reference scan enforced as part of `npm run build` to block host-internal bridge symbols and workspace paths from shipping in the published tarball.
