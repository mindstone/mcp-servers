# Changelog

All notable changes to `@mindstone/mcp-server-microsoft-sharepoint` are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- `get_recent_files`: tool description and response now state explicitly that results come from the user's personal OneDrive (`/me/drive/recent`), not from SharePoint site document libraries, removing a scope-confusion trap in a SharePoint-branded connector.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-07-03

### Changed

- Envelope external Microsoft 365 content in <untrusted-content> before returning to the model (FOX-3490); float microsoft-shared to ^0.1.0 (0.1.1).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-19

### Documentation

- Rewrote `README.md` to follow the structure in [`docs/CONNECTOR_README_GUIDE.md`](../../docs/CONNECTOR_README_GUIDE.md): added an npm-version badge, an italic positioning line, the `## Status` block with hyperlinked evidence and `Hosts tested` / `Machine-readable` rows, a `## Why this exists` section, an `## Example interaction` block, `## Host configuration examples` (Claude Desktop / Cursor and local development), the `(36)` tool count in the `## Tools` heading, and a `## Security notes` section.
- Added the connector to the table in the repo-root `README.md`.

### Planned
- Migrate to `@mindstone/mcp-server-microsoft-shared` from its npm-registry version once `0.1.0` of the shared package is published; the `0.1.0` cohort port currently consumes the shared package as a packed `file:` dependency.
- Tighten Zod validation of Microsoft Graph response payloads in `0.2.0` or later.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-19

Initial public release of the Microsoft 365 SharePoint MCP server. Thirty-six tools across SharePoint auth, sites, document libraries, pages, lists, metadata, search, and mutation operations via Microsoft Graph.

### Added
- Full 36-tool SharePoint surface, preserving bundled snake_case names 1:1, including `authenticate_sharepoint`.
- Host-orchestrated auth handoff: `authenticate_sharepoint` emits structured `auth_required` for incremental SharePoint consent (`microsoft.connect_sharepoint` + `setupToolName: authenticate_sharepoint`).
- Token-refresh fail-closed mode via `MICROSOFT_DISABLE_REFRESH=1` (defaults to off; the cloud surface flips it on so tokens cannot rotate without the desktop session).
- Cohort 60s upstream-request timeout with `MICROSOFT_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` override; composed abort signals propagate to all Graph requests via `.options({ signal })`.

### Security
- Uses the new `McpServer + registerTool + Zod` SDK pattern (cohort `MCP_SERVER_STANDARD`).
- Reads version from `package.json` via `createRequire(import.meta.url)`, so the reported server version cannot drift from the npm artifact.
- Internal-reference scan enforced as part of `npm run build` to block host-internal bridge symbols and workspace paths from shipping in the published tarball.
